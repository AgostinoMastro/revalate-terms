      <h2>7. Fees, Payment, Subscription, and Free Trial</h2>
      <p><strong>7.1. Fees and Subscriptions.</strong> Use of the Service may require payment of subscription fees, as set forth on the Revalate website or as otherwise communicated to you.

      <p><strong>7.2. Free Trial.</strong> Revalate may, at its sole discretion, offer a free trial for a limited period. The duration and terms of the free trial are subject to change at any time with reasonable notice.
